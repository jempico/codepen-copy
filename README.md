As part of WesBos CSS Grid Course, I recreated a web application like codePen from scratch using only CSS Grid.

Things I've learned while doing it:

1. How to take advantage of Firefox CSS Grid Dev Tools to inspect the elements of each grid.
2. How to create a fully responsive header combining CSS Grid and FlexBox.
3. How to hide/show a menu bar depending on media queries.
4. How to add responsiveness to the code editors with javaScript.
