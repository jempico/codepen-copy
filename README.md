As part of WesBos CSS Grid Course, I recreated a web application like codePen from scratch using only CSS Grid.

Things I've learned while doing it:

1. How to take advantage of CSS Grid Dev Tools to inspect the elements of each grid.
2. How to create a fully responsive header with CSS Grid.
3. How to add responsiveness to the code editors with javaScript.
